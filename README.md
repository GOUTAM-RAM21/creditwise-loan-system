# creditwise-loan-system
End-to-end machine learning project for predicting loan approval using Logistic Regression, KNN, and Naive Bayes, with Streamlit-based deployment.
# 🏦 Smart Loan Approval System (CreditWise Loan System)

An end-to-end **Machine Learning–based Loan Approval Prediction System** that helps determine whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on applicant financial and demographic details.

This project demonstrates the **complete ML pipeline** — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using **Streamlit**.
